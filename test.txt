Cleopatra was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, known for her intelligence, political skill, and legendary beauty. She became queen at just 18 years old and sought to preserve Egypt’s independence amid the growing power of Rome. Fluent in several languages and highly educated, Cleopatra formed powerful alliances with Julius Caesar and later Mark Antony. Her reign marked the end of ancient Egypt’s pharaonic era, and her dramatic life and tragic death have made her one of most fascinating and enduring figures of history.
